<p>
  <samp>My name is Isaque Lima, I am 22 years old and I am a Systems Analyst. I am passionate about technology and programming, and I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development from the University of Vila Velha. <br> <br> I started my career as a developer in 2018 and have accumulated experience with several technologies, including TypeScript, React and Node.js.
