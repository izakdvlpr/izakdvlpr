## `$ whoami`

Isaque, 19, but you can call me [Izak](https://github.com/izakdvlpr). I was interested in the software development area at the age of 15 with the Javascript language, over time I fell in love with the language. Today I develop with Node.js, React.js and React Native.

## `$ cd ~/repos`

- I am currently working as a developer at [Hitechline](https://hitechline.com.br).

## `$ cd ~/technologies`

#### `$ ls languages`

- Every project of mine I will probably start with [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/), because [JavaScript](https://javascript.com/) alone is too painful xD.
- I just enjoy playing with [Python](https://python.org/) sometimes.
- In my spare time I'm studying [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and developing plugins for minecraft with [Java](https://java.com/) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

#### `$ ls frameworks`

**`backend`**

- Without [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) programming would be sad.
- I love working with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) without a doubt.
- Working with tables and typing [MySQL](https://mysql.com/) commands in a terminal is awesome.
- For small projects I like to implement [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/).
- There's no way, without tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) it's hard to program.

**`frontend`**

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) will dominate the web for sure.
- I love working with [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/CSS) on the web.
- When I use GraphQL in my projects, [Apollo](https://apollographql.com/) with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) are great together.
- Any web project I will host on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).

**`mobile`**

- In most projects I prefer to use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) already in smaller [Expo](https://expo.dev/).

#### `$ ls tools`

- I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to program in most of my projects with the exception of [Java](https://java.com/) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) which I prefer to use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
- I always generate some container with [Docker](https://docker.com/), either for database or upload projects.
- I'm currently using [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).
